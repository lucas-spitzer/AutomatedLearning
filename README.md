# Automated Learning Project

## What?
The Automated Learning Project will send text messages directly to my phone twice each day. A message delivered to start and end my day will contain an explanation and visualization of complex concepts. This will allow repetition, and remind me of the subject. The visualization will be an animated image to help associate and remember the concept.

## Why? 
Often I find myself reading about a data science or computer science abstraction and a few days later the idea begins to slip my mind. With the help of this tool, I will be reminded of these concepts more frequently and eventually retain them within my long-term memory. Additionally, I aim to showcase my ability to automate tasks using Python.

## How?
The project will comprise two files. The first will be a Jupyter Notebook showing how I create and upload my mp4 files to a s3 bucket. The second file will be a Python script that utilizes Twilio to send these mp4s to my phone each day at 8am and 8pm EST. The file will be set to run using the Windows task scheduler on my personal computer.
