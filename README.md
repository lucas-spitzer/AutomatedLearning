# Automated Learning Project

## What?
The Automated Learning Project will send text messages directly to my phone twice each day. A message delivered to start and end my day containing an animated visualization of a complex concept. I have created these videos through Canva to optimize for a mental connection between image and concept.

## Why? 
Often I find myself reading about a data science or computer science abstraction and a few days later the idea begins to slip my mind. With the help of this tool, I will be reminded of these concepts more frequently and eventually retain them within my long-term memory. Additionally, I aim to showcase my ability to automate tasks using Python.

## How?
The project will comprise a Python script that utilizes Discord.py to send these mp4s through discord (viewable by my phone and laptop) at 8am and 8pm EST. The file will be set to run using the Windows task scheduler on my personal computer.
